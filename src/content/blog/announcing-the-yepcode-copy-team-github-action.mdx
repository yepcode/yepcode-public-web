### What are GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation platform that allows you to create custom workflows directly in your GitHub repositories. By defining workflows in YAML files, you can automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying code. GitHub Actions supports a wide range of triggers, such as code pushes, pull requests, and more, making it a versatile tool for DevOps and CI/CD pipelines.

### Introducing the YepCode Copy Team GitHub Action

We are excited to introduce our new YepCode Copy Team GitHub Action! This action is designed to ensure seamless synchronization of processes and modules between YepCode workspaces. It's perfect for promoting your staging environment to production without any hassle.
