We are thrilled to announce that YepCode has achieved the SOC2 Type I security certification! ðŸŽ‰ This milestone is a testament to our unwavering commitment to the highest standards of security and data protection for our customers.

#### What is SOC2 Type I Certification?

SOC2 (System and Organization Controls 2) is an auditing procedure that ensures service providers manage customer data with the highest standards of security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. The Type I certification evaluates the effectiveness of our systems and controls at a specific point in time.

#### Why This Matters

In today's digital landscape, security is more critical than ever. Achieving SOC2 Type I certification demonstrates that YepCode has established rigorous policies, procedures, and practices to safeguard our customers' data. This certification provides our clients with the assurance that their data is secure with us, enabling them to focus on what they do bestâ€”innovating and growing their businesses.

#### Our Commitment to Security

At YepCode, security is at the core of everything we do. From our robust microservices architecture to our comprehensive CI/CD practices, we ensure that every layer of our platform adheres to the highest security standards. Here are a few ways we prioritize security:

-   **Data Encryption**: We use advanced encryption methods to protect data at rest and in transit.
-   **Access Controls**: We implement strict access controls and authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.
-   **Regular Audits**: We conduct regular security audits and assessments to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

If you have any questions about our SOC 2 Type II compliance or any other aspect of our security and data protection practices, you can check out [https://trust.yepcode.io/](https://trust.yepcode.io/), or [contact us](https://yepcode.io/contact) directly.

#### GDPR Compliance

In addition to our SOC2 Type I certification, we are also proud to announce that YepCode is fully GDPR compliant. This compliance ensures that we meet the stringent data protection and privacy regulations set forth by the European Union, further reinforcing our commitment to protecting customer data.

#### Our Certification Journey

To support our certification process, we partnered with [Vanta](https://www.vanta.com/), a leading platform that streamlines SOC2 compliance. Vanta provided us with the tools and guidance needed to ensure our systems met the rigorous SOC2 standards. The audit was conducted by [Prescient Assurance](https://www.prescientassurance.com/), a trusted name in security and compliance assessments. Their thorough evaluation confirmed that YepCode adheres to the highest security protocols.

#### Whatâ€™s Next?

Achieving SOC2 Type I certification is just the beginning. We are committed to continuous improvement and will soon be working towards SOC2 Type II certification, which evaluates the effectiveness of our security practices over a period of time.

#### Thank You

We want to extend our heartfelt thanks to our dedicated team and loyal customers. This achievement would not have been possible without your trust and support. As we continue to innovate and expand our platform, rest assured that security will always remain a top priority at YepCode.

Our main target market is Enterprise companies, where certifications like SOC2 and GDPR compliance are essential. This milestone underscores our dedication to meeting the highest security standards demanded by our enterprise clients.

Stay tuned for more updates and exciting developments. Hereâ€™s to building a more secure and efficient future together!

Thank you for being a part of our journey.
