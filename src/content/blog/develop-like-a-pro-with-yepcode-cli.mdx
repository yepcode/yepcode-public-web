Today we are going to talk about a **brand-new feature in the YepCode** universe, our **CLI** and its importance in the development environment as a common and frequently used tool to operate and **speed up coding processes**.

### **But first, what is a CLI ?**

CLI responds to the acronym of (**Command Line Interface**) and it is a program on your computer that allows you to create and delete files, execute operating system functions, run programs or navigate through your folders and files.

Back in the 60s, CLI was the only way to communicate with computers, so developers used it frequently.

Then the mouse would appear and the point-and-click method would begin as a new way of interacting with the computer.

### **Why a CLI in YepCode?**

In YepCode, we have implemented the Command Line Interface that allows **interacting with your YepCode Cloud account from your workstation command line**.

To implement it, we use **TypeScript**, relying on [**Oclif**](https://t.sidekickopen00-eu1.com/s3t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7kC8dDZCHW5dK2qR2zGCz1N5xLs7slrBrYW1S-5-y3cR5_6MXwSPM3ZvWtf21mVPW02?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW43P1nS3LD2rJ1V3&si=8000000020810203&pi=87dddb93-7237-40e9-c267-cb34e43c9970) and attacking YepCode's **GraphQL API**.

This may be very useful if you prefer to write and test the process's source code in your local workspace instead of using the web IDE of YepCode Cloud.

We follow a **GIT approach**, which allows us to run clone, execute pull & push commands and manage conflicts if someone changes process files in the cloud.

The local copy of your team account will include **the processes source code**, **your js-modules** and also **the credentials & variables non-sensitive information.**

### **Some interesting use cases for YepCode CLI**

##### Sync your source code with a GIT repository

All the source code you write in YepCode is yours, and although we [**support versioning**](https://docs.yepcode.io/processes/process-versioning), it may be interesting to **keep a copy** of it in some **GIT** repository.

When you run the CLI clone command, a file structure is generated with all your file information.

A _.gitignore_ is also created, so just _init_ your GIT _repo_ and do a _push_ to the remote server.

##### Avoid Yeps consumption during the development phases

During the development process, you may be **trying executions to get the final implementation**.

There is no problem with doing this in the YepCode cloud, but that executions

If you prefer to save the yeps for the real executions, you **may develop in your local workstationand you will not consume any yeps**.

##### Integrate with CI/CD cycles

YepCode Cloud doesn't include testing features, but YepCode CLI opens a wide range of **options to check that your implementation is ok**.

You may **install the CLI in your CI/CD platform and run some processes with test parameters** (for example the environment).

If the test executions finish ok, then you may automate the _push_ command to the YepCode Cloud.

We believe the YepCode CLI will give you more control over your computer and is a powerful time saver.

Check it here and learn [**how to install YepCode CLI**](https://docs.yepcode.io/cli/) in your team account.

Happy coding!
