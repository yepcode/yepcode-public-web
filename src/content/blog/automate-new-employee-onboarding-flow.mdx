When you hire new employees, it is not an easy task to have a **successful onboarding process**. There is a lot of paperwork to do and, depending on the company, it may be necessary to **register them in multiple systems** (email, ERP, PM System, database, etc).

In fact, if your company is not big enough to have its own human resources department. You will need to dedicate **valuable time from other team members to accomplish these tasks.**

Let's look at an example of a technology company that was able to **succeed, save time and minimize human error** by automating this employee onboarding process.

### **Automating the employee onboarding flow of a tech-company**

[**Trileuco Solutions**](https://trileucosolutions.com/en) is the software development company behind YepCode.

They were born in 2010. Today they have a **team of developers** passionate about technology who have a wide range of skills in the most popular programming languages, including Java, C++, Python, PHP, and JavaScript.Among their services, they offer **mobile and web application development**, as well as custom development, design and **consulting**.

They focus on delivering high-quality products and developing **custom software solutions** to meet their customer's business needs.

### **How can the automation of the employee onboarding flow help you?**

Currently, they have over 30 employees. Although their rotation ratio is not quite high, **each new employee onboarding is quite time-consuming,** creating accounts over several systems and services.

In the same way, every time they have an **offboarding**, they must remove that user account from many systems, making sure that person has no longer access to their systems.

Their legacy approach to solving this was to have the documentation properly updated in a Notion document. However, that was **causing their IT and HR teams to perform manual tasks** on whatever services users should have access to. This could also **cause some human error** which they should try to avoid.

With the irruption of YepCode, they decided that a great use case could be to **automate this onboarding flow.** To do so, they had to create a process that would accept the **new employee's information** (name, email, services and roles), and **perform the necessary changes in each related service to create and configure that user account.**

In the same way, they could **automatethe offboarding flow.** Simply by requesting the user's email, and **removing the necessary information from each system.**

### But is it always necessary to automate this onboarding process? Let's go through our process.

Some of the systems involved in this case were **Keycloak** (which is their identity provider. But any other solution like **Ldap**, **Okta** or **Auth0** could be easily used with their integrations). They have a git repository (they use **BitBucket**, but other services like **GitHub** or **Gitlab** could be integrated). **Mattermost** (is their IM). They use **Redmine** as their project management tool. They have one internal app for **absences management.** And finally, they have all the **Kubernetes** cluster-related services (Prometheus, Kibana,...).

So far, they have already integrated most of their services with their identity provider. So that, the signup in that service simplifies the user creation. However, with the others, it **is required a fine-grained configuration** that they have done with each **service API** or directly with changes in the needed databases.

After this process implementation, the HR team only has to **ask supervisors what roles each new employee should have.** Then**,** they can **configure it with the input parameters form** in the onboarding execution.

For the **offboarding process**, the only parameter required is the e-mail. After the execution, all the user accounts are **disabled in less than a minute**.
