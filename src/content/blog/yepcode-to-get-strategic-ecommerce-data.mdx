As seen before, [**YepCode can be used for tedious ETL tasks**](https://yepcode.io/using-yepcode/how-to-automate-efficiently-data-movements-from-google-bigquery-to-snowflake/) that can be time-consuming to perform. Just simply using its automation potential.

From the point of view that we can offer as its creators, we believe that the potential of Yepcode is enormous. And **capable of dealing with very complex processes that involve the treatment of large volumes of data,** in a very efficient way.

Today, we are happy to tell you **how to retrieve, filter and extract your most important e-commerce data.** This can help you improve your business and save time configuring servers, tools or scripts.

### So, let's code!

This example shows how we can use [**#YepCode**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/YepCode?src=hashtag_click) to retrieve information from a **MySQL** database of an online store built with **Woocommerce** and expose that information to a **JSON-formatted HTTP endpoint.**

The first step to get the most out of your e-commerce data is to create a credential that stores the information to access the MySQL **database by giving access to them from YepCode cloud.**

We’ll use the [**YepCode tunneling system**](https://docs.yepcode.io/network-access), which allows using SSH tunnels to connect to services behind a firewall.

Next, we’ll create a new process accepting the product name filter as a parameter.

We’ll use promises to ensure that the result is returned after every needed work has been done.

Then we’ll add the process source **code** to:

-   Open the database **connection**
-   Run the **query** with the filter as param
-   Close **connection**
-   And return the **results**

As we want to expose that information in an HTTP **endpoint,** we’ll create a new **Webhook** **Trigger** that will generate a **cURL** sample to run the Webhook from a terminal.

We’ll run a synchronous execution to retrieve and show the final result.

Remember that our [**Docs platform**](https://docs.yepcode.io/) includes every single detail to make the most out of YepCode,

You can watch this process in the next video!

Happy coding!
