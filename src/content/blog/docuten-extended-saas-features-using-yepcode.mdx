[**Docuten**](https://docuten.com) is a leader in **administrative processes digitalization**, transforming clients into "paperless companies”.

They achieve that by digitally converting any administrative processes through **digital signature, electronic invoicing and payments**. By relying on **Docuten** as their sole provider, companies can **reduce costs** by 50%. In addition, they can perform this deployment 2.5 times faster than working with several different providers.

‍**Docuten has recently started to use YepCode**. Their main goal is to validate some new functionalities before including them in their core **Saas product**.

Here is a good example of how they are doing this. There is a **YepCode process** that allows Docuten to offer their clients to **receive invoices in several electronic invoice formats that are not yet in their core product**.

Their platform works mainly with factura-e invoice format. And they may place the generated invoices in an **FTP server.**

The created YepCode process **opens a connection to that FTP server,** looking for some newly generated invoices. This connection is possible thanks to the use of our [**SFTP integration**](https://docs.yepcode.io/integrations/sftp). If any new invoices appear on the server, they are converted to another invoice format using an [**XML parser**](https://docs.yepcode.io/libraries/fast-xml-parser). After that, the **new documents are uploaded again to the FTP server**.

With this simple process, Docuten is able to offer **several electronic invoice formats to their clients.** These formats may be extended by publishing [**new versions of the YepCode process.**](https://docs.yepcode.io/processes/process-versioning) Additionally, this process hasn't modified their core product at all.

In conclusion, we believe that using **YepCode** with this strategy can **help many Saas companies to validate new features.** As a result, they will be able to improve their core business **with minimal effort.**
