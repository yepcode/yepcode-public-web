# **YepCode now supports Python - Streamline your Integrations and Automations**

After a long time listening to our users' requests, we are finally super excited to announce a new milestone in our roadmap. Our development team has been working hard to make it possible and finally, this is it, YepCode now supports Python!

Our all-in-one platform allows development teams to create integrations and connect services and APIs in an agile way within a serverless environment. And now, we're going one step further by extending our technical capabilities to include a new programming language. With all that this entails.

So why is this a big deal? Well, implementing Python means that we can further expand our business and help even more developers meet their needs. And let's face it, Python is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, so it just makes sense for us to support it.

## **Why Python is a Great Language for Integrations and Automation? There are good reasons**

For those of you who are not familiar with Python, let us fill you in! Python is a high-level programming language that is easy to learn and use. It is ideal for beginners and experts alike, and is used in a wide variety of fields, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning.

Python's simplicity and readability make it an excellent language for building integrations and automations. Its extensive libraries and frameworks also make it easy to connect to many services and APIs. Additionally, Python's cross-platform compatibility and dynamic typing make it a versatile language to be used for countless applications.

One of the best things about Python is its flexibility. You can use it for everything from simple scripts to complex applications, and it has a huge library of pre-built modules and tools to help you get your work done. And because it's so popular, there are tons of resources and communities out there to help you learn and get support.

Some of its key features are:

-   Easy to learn and read code

-   Extensive libraries and frameworks for various applications, including machine learning and data analysis

-   Interpreted language, meaning no compilation is required

-   Cross-platform compatibility

-   Dynamically typed, meaning variables do not need to be declared before use

## **What technical aspects have we developed to include Python in YepCode?**

We know that Python was a highly requested feature, so our team of developers is working extensively tirelessly to adapt our integrations and recipes to Python, as well as include Python snippets in our documentation, so you have everything you need to get started.

In our editor, you can see and prove the code to implement your processes. Depending on the language you want to use, the script will be executed in a different engine. In the case of using Python, we use the [**Python v3 engine**](https://www.python.org/)**,** so you can almost every function that Python supports.

YepCode allows using external services through integrations This makes it possible to read and publish information from and to databases, APIs, SaaS, Storage Systems, etc. Python integrations rely on open-source packages. We use [**pip**](https://pypi.org/), the package installer for Python.

We have also included some well-known libraries that will help you to write your scripts in the most agile way in both JavaScript and Python languages.

In addition to these integration libraries, we also allow using all [**Python built-in modules**](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html).

### **How do I get started with Python in YepCode?**

To get started with Python in YepCode, simply create a new recipe or integration and select Python as the language. You can then use our built-in Python snippets or add your code to customize your integration. And if you're new to Python, don't worry - our documentation includes plenty of resources to help you get started.

### **Whatâ€™s next on our roadmap?**

We are releasing new Python features every week. So we are working now to implement new Python Modules that will allow you to define an isolated set of Python functions to be reused from any of your processes.

These modules can help you share functions between processes to solve some business logic problem, encapsulate access to a service, or any other purpose where splitting the code into modules makes sense.

Whether you're looking to streamline your integrations, automate your workflows, or perform complex ETL processes, YepCode with Python has got you covered. So why wait?

Try it for yourself and see how YepCode can simplify your development process today.

Thanks for reading, and as always, happy coding!
