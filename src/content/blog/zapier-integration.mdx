No-code tools are amazing — until they're not.

You've been there: you're building a Zapier workflow and hit a wall. You need to transform a payload, query a custom API, or run some logic that's just too complex for built-in steps.

That's exactly where YepCode Run comes in — and we're excited to announce that it's now available directly inside Zapier 🎉

## What's new?

With the new **YepCode Run connector**, you can now:

- ✅ Execute any custom serverless function right from your Zaps
- ✅ Define input parameters and map them easily from previous steps
- ✅ Use LLM-generated or prebuilt code to connect with APIs, query databases, transform files, and more
- ✅ Rely on any NPM or PyPI library — YepCode handles all the infrastructure and dependencies

This means **you get the power of full-code** without leaving the Zapier ecosystem.

## Great fallback for AI agents

If you're exploring AI agents inside Zapier (like with OpenAI or Claude), this is a game-changer.

Let's say your agent can generate the right script — but it needs somewhere to run it.

Now it can. Securely. Reliably.

With YepCode, agents get a powerful execution environment that makes it easy to go from suggestion to action — from “this is the code” to “done.”

## Ideal for:

- Custom API integrations
- AI-powered automation
- Data transformations
- Workarounds when Zapier's native actions fall short
- Teams who need flexibility without building infra

👉 Ready to give it a spin?

We'd love to hear what you build — and we're open to co-develop proof-of-concept automations for interesting use cases.

Let's push automation further, together.

With YepCode, you're always just one script away from unlocking anything.
