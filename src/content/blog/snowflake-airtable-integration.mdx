[**Airtable**](https://www.airtable.com/) and [**Snowflake**](https://www.snowflake.com/) are two of the big players in the modern **databases ecosystem.**‚Äç

Their approach is quite different. **Snowflake** focus on **data warehouse** features **allowing the management of enormous amounts of information** in a faster and more flexible way than traditional databases. **Airtable**, on the other hand, is more similar to Excel on steroids, **allowing to build powerful applications with a NoCode approach**.

### How can I move data from Snowflake to Airtable with YepCode?

In this post we'll show how **YepCode** may be **used to move information between these two SaaS**, creatinga generic process that receives the following input **parameters**:

-   The Snowflake query to be executed
-   The Airtable base & view names
-   The (optional) mapping between Snowflake and Airtable column names
-   A flag to decide if use streams instead of loading all query results in memory (more suitable for a great number of rows)

The process will start by **opening the connection** to Snowflake.

Then it will **run the query in an asynchronous way** (using JS promises).

When the query **returns all the rows** (or for each row in the streamed approach), **it will create new entries in Airtable** using the correct column mapping.

### **Ok, but too much text, show me code!**

In this case, **we are not doing a _copy&paste_** of the full process code (as we have done in one previous post for [**Cryptocurrency dollar-cost averaging sample**](https://yepcode.io/yepcode-universe/cryptocurrency-dollar-cost-averaging-using-yepcode/). Here, we only reference a public view of the process that is already created in our [**Sandbox account**](https://docs.yepcode.io/quickstart/sandbox).

From that public page, you couldn't run the sample, but you only have to [**create your own YepCode account**](https://yepcode.io/get-started/) and create the needed [**Airtable**](https://docs.yepcode.io/integrations/airtable) **and** [**Snowflake**](https://docs.yepcode.io/integrations/snowflake) credentials to start to use it!
