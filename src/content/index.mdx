        description: "A one-sentence pitch for YepCode could be **'The Zapier for developers'**.<br/><br/>Have you ever tried to create a loop in any of these NoCode tools? Or process a query result set with thousands of records? Or merge information from a streamed result set from Snowflake with a GraphQl service?<br/><br/>Those kinds of tools are great to solve simple automations, but when you need to solve a complex problem, you'd prefer to write the source code and enjoy a serverless environment that helps you with the execution and monitoring of tasks.<br/><br/>Unlike other tools, **YepCode has no vendor lock-in**, as it allows you to save and export the generated code. This is very useful if you want to set up a new server from scratch and run the code there.",
