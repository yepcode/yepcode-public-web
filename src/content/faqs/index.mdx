    {
      title: "What is YepCode?",
      description: "YepCode is a SaaS platform that allows to create, execute and monitor integrations and automations using source code in a serverless environment.",
    },
    {
      title: "What are the benefits of YepCode over NoCode tools like Zapier or Make?",
      description: "A one-sentence pitch for YepCode could be **'The Zapier for developers'**.<br/><br/>Have you ever tried to create a loop in any of these NoCode tools? Or process a query result set with thousands of records? Or merge information from a streamed result set from Snowflake with a GraphQl service?<br/><br/>Those kinds of tools are great to solve simple automations, but when you need to solve a complex problem, you'd prefer to write the source code and enjoy a serverless environment that helps you with the execution and monitoring of tasks.<br/><br/>Unlike other tools, **YepCode has no vendor lock-in**, as it allows you to save and export the generated code. This is very useful if you want to set up a new server from scratch and run the code there.",
    },
    {
      title: "What are the benefits of YepCode over deploying an Amazon Lambda function or building a project from scratch and deploying it on Heroku?",
      description: "We have created a full development and execution environment that works out of the box. Webhooks triggering, query logs, task scheduling, input params forms, versioning...<br/><br/>Forget about that related tasks and focus on solving your business problems. No servers provisioning neither deployments. Just code!",
    },
    {
      title: "How do I get started?",
      description: "You only have to follow the [Sign up flow](https://cloud.yepcode.io) and your account will be created with our DEVELOPER plan (no credit card required). Then you'll be able to perform a plan upgrade when you need it.<br/><br/>If you just want to snoop around, you may prefer to get access to our [sandbox account](https://yepcode.io/docs/quickstart/sandbox), where some samples are implemented.",
    },
    {
      title: "What is a process",
      description: "A [YepCode process](https://yepcode.io/docs/processes) is the component in charge of implementing some business logic by executing a piece of source code.<br/><br/>That source code can be JavaScript or Python secure and scalable engine.<br/><br/>Processes may also include an input params form and a readme file.",
    },
    {
      title: "What is an execution?",
      description: "Is the action of [running one process](https://yepcode.io/docs/executions) using some of the provided methods: on demand, scheduling it or using webhooks.",
    },
    {
      title: "Can I use my services behind a firewall from YepCode Saas?",
      description: "Yes! We have created a secure [tunneling system](https://yepcode.io/docs/network-access) that allows you to open connections from YepCode to your internal network.",
    },
    {
      title: "Are my credentials stored securely?",
      description: "Of course! Every piece of sensitive information is fully encrypted in our database, and it can only be used where it is needed (just in the execution phase).",
    },
    {
      title: "Do I need to know how to write code to use YepCode?",
      description: "Yes. If you (or your team) don't have coding skills, YepCode is not your tool.<br/><br/>The process implementation must be done by writing the source code and using the integrations and libraries provided.",
    },
    {
      title: "What are the execution limits (time, memory & logs)?",
      description: "We have created a detailed [plans and limits](https://yepcode.io/docs/plans-and-limits) page in our docs platform.",
    },
    {
      title: "How can I integrate YepCode with other apps?",
      description: "YepCode can send and receive information from several services using [integrations](https://yepcode.io/docs/integrations).<br/><br/>If you need to start executions from external services, [webhooks](https://yepcode.io/docs/executions/webhooks) may help you. Just configure the endpoint and send the parameters for the execution in the request body. This will allow you to use YepCode as one piece inside your systems infrastructure.",
    },
    {
      title: "Is it possible to reuse code between processes?",
      description: "Yes! We love clean code, so we have created the [Modules](https://yepcode.io/docs/modules) feature to share code between your processes and follow the DRY pattern.",
    },
    {
      title: "Where can I find some samples to get started?",
      description: "In our [sandbox account](https://yepcode.io/docs/quickstart/sandbox) you can find several sample processes that use almost all the features that YepCode supports.<br/><br/>Also, in our [blog](/blog), we publish case studies to show the full power of YepCode.<br/><br/>In both cases, you can use the [import / export](https://yepcode.io/docs/processes/import-export) feature to copy the processes to your own YepCode account.",
    },
    {
      title: "Is it possible to share a YepCode account for multi-member development team?",
      description: "[YepCode teams](https://yepcode.io/docs/settings/teams) are designed to be used by several developers, so feel free to invite your colleagues to work together.",
    },
    {
      title: "Is it possible to export all my team processes implementation?",
      description: "YepCode [command line interface](https://yepcode.io/docs/cli) is available on paid plans, and it allows to export a full copy of your team workspace.<br/><br/>This allows to sync all the code created in YepCode with any Git repository, and you could also run the processes in your local workstation.",
    },
    {
      title: "Does YepCode have Lock-in?",
      description: "**Save and export your generated code**, so if at any time you prefer to configure a new server from scratch and execute the code there, you can do so. We talk about that in this [blog entry](/blog/we-avoid-the-vendor-lock-in).<br/><br/>We are sure of the value that YepCode can bring to our users in their daily work and we don't want to limit them.",
