YepCode allows you to manage different versions of your processes and modules, so then you may start executions using an specific version source code.

## Manage versions

You can publish a version from the process pages by clicking `Publish version` in the three dots menu.

<Screenshot src="publish-version.png" />

This action will display a form where you should write a tag for the new process version and a comment for the version if desired.

Once you create the version, you can view its code by changing to it in the version selector. It's important to note that you cannot edit the code of a published version. To continue editing your process, simply return to the current version using the selector and continue coding!

Having a version published, you can select that version source code to be used when you start any process execution.

## Run now with version

During one [on-demand execution](/docs/executions/on-demand), you can select the version source code be used:

## Scheduled execution with version

For [scheduled executions](/docs/executions/scheduled), you can also select the version source code be used:

## Webhook execution with version

For [webhook executions](/docs/executions/webhooks), you should pass the `Yep-Version-Tag` HTTP Header to use one version source code:

## Version aliases

To maximize the utility of versions, we introduce version aliasesâ€”pointers to a process or module version that you can update with ease.

This feature addresses the need to change the version used by an external service without deploying changes to that service.

Consider a scenario where an external service calls YepCode via a webhook, specifying a process version (e.g., `v1.0`) in the invocation header. When you release a new process version (e.g., `v2.0`) and want to switch to it, updating the external service can be cumbersome. Instead, by using an alias in the webhook invocation (e.g., `stable`), initially linked to version `v1.0`, you can seamlessly transition to version `v2.0` by simply updating the alias in the YepCode UI.

This approach eliminates the need to modify the external service, making version management more efficient.

Version aliases can be used exactly in the same scenarios where process versions are available: run now, webhooks or scheduled configurations.

## Modules versioning and aliases

YepCode Modules also support versions and aliases. See [modules docs page](/docs/processes/modules) to see how one version or alias can be selected during module import.
