import Screenshot from "@components/Screenshot.astro";

YepCode allows you to share your processes. To do this, you have to set the process visibility as public in the [dashboard](/docs/processes/dashboard).

When your process is public, you can copy the link from the [dashboard](/docs/processes/dashboard) or access it from the sidebar.

<Screenshot src="share-process-btn.png" />

This button will display a modal where you can copy the public process link.

Anyone who accesses the link can view your public process.
