In YepCode processes, documentation is key. We've made it easy for you by providing a dedicated `README` tab in the process editor. This tab allows you to add essential information that introduces and explains the purpose of your source code.

Similar to input parameters, you can preview the rendered README with its [Markdown syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
