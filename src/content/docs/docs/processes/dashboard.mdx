- **General**:
  - **Name**: process name (must be unique across all processes).
  - **Slug**: friendly process identifier (must be unique across all processes). You can use it in [Webhooks](/docs/executions/webhooks) and [Forms](/docs/forms) instead of the process ID.
  - **Description**: process description.
- **Forms**: Enable or disable forms integration for this process. This feature allows you to embed process input parameter forms in any webpage. Refer to the full [form documentation](/docs/forms) for more details.
- **Visibility**: Toggle between [public](/docs/processes/shared) and private. When your process is public, you can edit the process URL token (must be unique across all processes).

## Versions

Explore detailed information about all your [process versions](/docs/processes/process-versioning) in the Versions tab.

If your process has no versions, this tab will not be visible.
