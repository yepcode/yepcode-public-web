When working with YepCode processes, you can configure input parameters to gather information from users before starting an [on-demand](/docs/executions/on-demand) or [scheduled](/docs/executions/scheduled) execution. Input parameters also play a role in defining [webhook](/docs/executions/webhooks) bodies.

The process edition includes a JSON editor which is used to define the process input parameter form.

In your process source code, you can access the provided input parameters using the following helper:

<Tabs syncKey="programming-language">
  <TabItem label="JavaScript" icon="seti:javascript">
```js
const {
  context: { parameters },
} = yepcode;
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Python" icon="seti:python">
```py
parameters = yepcode.context.parameters
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

With parameters defined, you can request any information needed to run your process. Forms can range from simple:

...to more complex configurations:

## Form Builder

YepCode provides a JSON Form Builder that allows you to manage input parameters without any coding.

You can create new input parameters, modify existing ones, or delete unnecessary ones.

## Parameters Definition

We use the JSON Schema form specification, and the library we use to render the form is [react-jsonschema-form](https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/docs/).

This allows you to use advanced configurations, such as [dependencies](https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/docs/usage/dependencies), which enable you to change fields based on entered data.

Additionally, YepCode offers extra attributes to enhance your experience:

### Sensitive Properties

Properties marked as sensitive are treated as passwords. They are stored encrypted in the database and won't be shown in the UI.

Here you have an example of a simple form with a sensitive property:

```json
{
  "title": "Input parameters",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "apiKey": {
      "title": "The API Key",
      "type": "string",
      "isSensitive": true
    }
  },
  "required": ["apiKey"]
}
```

### Transient properties

[Transient](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_(computer_programming)>) properties are only available for the execution and won't be stored in the database. An execution which receives transient parameters cannot be rerun,
as these type of parameters won't be available. They are shown with `[transient]` in the UI.

Here you have an example of a simple form with a transient property:

```json
{
  "title": "Input parameters",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "fileContent": {
      "title": "The content of the file",
      "type": "string",
      "isTransient": true
    }
  },
  "required": ["fileContent"]
}
```

### Validation

Validation is supported by this form specification and is checked upon form submission.

<Screenshot src="processes-input-params-validation.png" width="50%" />

:::info
By default, validation won't be enforced if the execution starts using non-submit form methods (e.g., [webhooks](/docs/executions/webhooks) or [API](https://cloud.yepcode.io/api/rest/public/swagger-ui/index.html)). If you want to enable this validation for all start methods, just activate the `Validate parameters schema` in the [settings](/docs/settings) page.

If you want to enforce validation, but for some process you want to allow additional properties, there is [a flag for this behaviour](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object#additionalproperties).
:::

### Content Customization

To provide greater flexibility to the forms and the content they display (titles, descriptions, help messages), we have improved and extended the schema to support markdown rendering using [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

With this functionality, you can format text in a simple and easy way to make it more readable. Here you have one sample:

```json title="JSON Schema attribute using Markdown"
  "oneStringField": {
    "title": "![alt text](https://cloud.yepcode.io/img/YepCode_logo_light.svg)  *[yepcode](https://yepcode.io)* form title",
    "description": "[yepcode](https://yepcode.io) form description",
    "type": "string"
  },
```

## Full sample

Here's a complete example of a Form and its schema:

<div className="YepCodeForm">
  <div
    data-yepcode-form-team="sandbox"
    data-yepcode-form-process="4d69f1b0-7e58-4d40-9e17-888ec546c66f"
  ></div>
</div>

<Code
  code={JSON.stringify(parametersSchemaEditorActions[0].code, null, 2)}
  lang="json"
  frame="none"
/>
