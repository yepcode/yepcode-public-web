# Tags

Tags are labels that help you organize related processes into logical groups. By tagging your processes, you can easily filter and find them later.

## Adding Tags to a Process

You can add tags to any process through the editor's right sidebar, where all current tags for that process are displayed.

To add a tag:

1. Click in the tag input field.
2. Either:
   - Type a new tag name to create a fresh tag and hit **Enter** to add it.
   - Select an existing tag from the dropdown that appears.

Using existing tags helps maintain consistency. Tags are shared across all processes.

## Filtering Processes by Tags

Once you've tagged your processes, you can filter them:

1. Navigate to your processes list
2. Use the tag filter input to select one or more tags
3. Click **Search** to apply the filter

This is especially useful as your collection of processes grows.
