title: On-Premise Deployments
description: We provide several flavors to get YepCode deployed in your system's infrastructure.

Some clients may find it interesting (or even required) to deploy YepCode in their infrastructure.

The YepCode architecture is described in [this blog post](https://yepcode.io/yepcode-universe/an-overview-of-yepcode-technology-stack/), and as you may guess, the deployment does not just involve a monolith project.

We have thought about that, and we provide two main flavors for on-premise installations:

- [Full Stack On-Premise](/docs/on-premise/full-stack)
- [Only Executors Layer On-Premise](/docs/on-premise/executors)
