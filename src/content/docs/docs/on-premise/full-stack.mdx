# Full Stack On-Premise Deployment

In this flavor, the entire YepCode microservices and related services (database, identity provider, etc.) are deployed.

All the microservices are dockerized, and we may provide a [Helm chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) to deploy the entire stack in a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster.

This deployment option is only available on **ENTERPRISE** plans, so please [contact us](https://yepcode.io/contact/) if you are interested in this flavor.
