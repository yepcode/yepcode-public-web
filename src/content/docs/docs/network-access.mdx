# Network Access

When using YepCode with a service that is not accessible from the internet, such as a Postgres server on your internal infrastructure or a REST API behind a firewall, you need to configure access to allow YepCode servers to connect.

## Configure Your Firewall for YepCode Access

Configure your firewalls to allow connections from the IP <b>34.89.54.108</b> for the required ports. This step ensures that YepCode integrations function seamlessly.

If altering your company's firewall rules is not feasible, we offer an alternative solution: tunneling.

## YepCode Tunneling

We provide a tunneling system that exposes your ports for YepCode using [SSH tunnels](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/tunneling).

With this approach, you start an agent on your network and then you configure the tunnel as destination from your YepCode credentials.

This deployment option is only available on paid plans, so please [contact us](https://yepcode.io/contact/) if you are interested in using this.
