Let's get started by embedding the simplest version of a YepCode form, and later we'll explore the full form configuration.

## Embedding the Form

There are two methods to embed a form on any external webpage:

- Using our JavaScript SDK that replaces DOM elements with forms
- Using the YepCodeForm [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) component

In both cases, you'll need two mandatory parameters:

- **yepcode-team-id**: Your team ID, available on your workspace URL `https://cloud.yepcode.io/<yepcode-team-id>`
- **yepcode-process-id**: Your process ID, available on your process URL `https://cloud.yepcode.io/<yepcode-team-id>/processes/<yepcode-process-id>`. For example, `fd7f9a83-2d3d-1af8-6c3f-b9caa68531b1`

### Method 1: Embed a Form using our JavaScript SDK

The first step is to place this snippet into the `head` tag of your website.

```html
<script defer="defer" src="https://yepcode.io/sdk/forms.js"></script>
```

It can be loaded globally on your website or just on the webpages where you want to embed forms.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem
    value="data"
    label="Init forms using data attributes"
  >
By default, the SDK looks for any DOM element containing the data attributes <code>data-yepcode-form-team</code> and <code>data-yepcode-form-process</code> and replaces each element with the full form rendering.

This is the simplest version of a form:

```html
<div
  data-yepcode-form-team="<yepcode-team-id>"
  data-yepcode-form-process="<yepcode-process-id>"
></div>
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem
    value="function"
    label="Init forms using YepCode.initForm function"
  >
Another approach to embed a form with our SDK is by calling a function exposed by the SDK. This function receives the DOM element selector and a JSON with the configuration:

```html
<div id="my-yepcode-form"></div>
<script>
  YepCode.initForm("#my-yepcode-form", {
    team: "<yepcode-team-id>",
    process: "<yepcode-process-id>",
  });
</script>
```

If you prefer to provide the DOM element itself, that is also supported:

```html
<div id="my-yepcode-form"></div>
<script>
  YepCode.initForm(document.getElementById("my-yepcode-form"), {
    team: "<yepcode-team-id>",
    process: "<yepcode-process-id>",
  });
</script>
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Method 2: Embed a form using `YepCodeForm` ReactJS component

:::info
It supports ReactJS versions 17 and 18
:::

- Install as an NPM package using your favourite package manager:

```sh
yarn add @yepcode/react-forms
```

or

```sh
npm install --save @yepcode/react-forms
```

- Import the component and render it in your ReactJS app:

```jsx
import YepCodeForm from "@yepcode/react-forms";

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <YepCodeForm
      team={"<yepcode-team-id>"}
      processId={"<yepcode-process-id>"}
    />
  );
};
```

:::note
If you are using a Server-Side Rendering framework like [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), use dynamic components [with no SSR](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import#with-no-ssr):

```jsx
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";

const YepCodeForm = dynamic(() => import("@yepcode/react-forms"), {
  ssr: false,
});

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <YepCodeForm
      team={"<yepcode-team-id>"}
      processId={"<yepcode-process-id>"}
    />
  );
};
```
