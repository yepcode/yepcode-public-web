title: Let's do the Hello World
description: Learn the basics of YepCode by implementing a Hello World sample.

In the world of programming tools, a **Hello World** sample is often the key to resolving initial doubts.

Watch this brief video during our onboarding tour to get an overview...

<br />

...but the best option is to create your account and implement it yourself!

To get started, log in to your account at [http://cloud.yepcode.io/](http://cloud.yepcode.io/) (if you don't have an account yet, you can create one in seconds!).

:::tip
For a quick exploration without creating an account, you can use our [Sandbox account](/docs/quickstart/sandbox) where the Hello World sample already exists.
:::

Navigate to your processes list page, which might be initially empty, but here you could see any previously created processes.

Click on the `New` button and provide a name and description for this new process. For this sample, we'll use JavaScript as the language:

<Screenshot src="create-new-process.png" caption="Hello world" />

Now you can input your source code into our editor. For this sample, you can use the following snippet:

<Tabs syncKey="programming-language">
  <TabItem label="JavaScript" icon="seti:javascript">
```js
const {
  context: { parameters },
} = yepcode;

const message = `Hello ${parameters.name}`;

console.log(message);

return {
  theMessage: message,
};
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Python" icon="seti:python">
```py
parameters = yepcode.context.parameters

message = f"Hello ${parameters['name']}."

print(message)

return {
    "theMessage": message,
}
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You should see something like this:

<Screenshot src="hello-world-source-code.png" />

As you might guess, YepCode supports input parameters. To configure them, go to the _parameters_ tab and add this JSON code in the input parameters editor:

```json
{
  "description": "The hello world input parameters",
  "type": "object",
  "title": "Hello world input parameters",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Type your name to receive a greeting"
    }
  },
  "required": ["name"]
}
```

It should look like this:

<Screenshot src="hello-world-input-params.png" />

Press the `Save` button and you're done with your process, let's run it! ðŸš€

There are multiple ways to run the process, but in this case, we'll go with the simplest one. Just press the run button and provide the input parameters:

<Screenshot src="hello-world-run-params.png" />

After that, you'll be redirected to the new execution page, where you can check how the execution is going and review the process output (in real-time if the process is still active):

<Screenshot src="hello-world-execution.png" />

Congratulations! Your first YepCode process is up and running.

Now let's move on to more complex tasks!
