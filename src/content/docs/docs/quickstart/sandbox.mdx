# YepCode Sandbox

If you just want to get into the platform to see how it works, you can use this sandbox account where we have included some sample processes.

Use this form to ask for the Sandbox credentials:

<div className="YepCodeForm">
  <div
    data-yepcode-form-team="yepcode"
    data-yepcode-form-process="ed8d47f6-8413-4dec-b8ed-30c302bcfb6c"
  ></div>
</div>

:::note
Once you create your account in YepCode, you'll also have access to this team.

You can find it in the team selector:
