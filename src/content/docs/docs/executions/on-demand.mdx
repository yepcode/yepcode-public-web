# On Demand Executions

The simplest execution type is the on demand, where the user starts the execution manually.

You only have to press the `Run` button from the process page

<Screenshot src="executions-run-now-icon.png" />

and the input params form will be shown (if configured). If you want, you can also add a comment about the execution.

<Screenshot src="executions-run-now.png" />

After providing the required information, the execution will start, showing the execution details page.

:::note
If your process has no versions, the version selector won't appear.
