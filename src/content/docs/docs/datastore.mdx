# YepCode Datastore

YepCode Datastore is a robust key-value storage system that is both simple and fast. It's designed to empower your processes through accessible [source code integration](/docs/processes/source-code/).

With YepCode Datastore, you can store and retrieve data within your processes and modules, facilitating information sharing across different executions. Unlock a myriad of possibilities, including:

- Preserving process states between executions (e.g., maintaining the last loaded date for use in subsequent executions of an ETL process).
- Efficient session management (e.g., performing a login only if your session has expired).
- Maintaining a shared team global state (e.g., tracking counters, execution usage, and more).

## Claim Your Access

Access to YepCode Datastore is exclusive to our [paid plans](/docs/plans-and-limits#datastore). If you're interested in trying it out, simply [reach out to us](https://yepcode.io/contact/).

## Usage

Manipulating Datastore values is accomplished through the following YepCode commands:
