## YepCode Tunneling

We provide a tunneling system that exposes your ports for YepCode using [SSH tunnels](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/tunneling). The server side is available at the domain `tunnels.yepcode.io`.

To create a tunnel, open SSH tunnels on a computer with access to the target service and internet connectivity. You have two options: use any SSH client or, if you have [Docker](https://docker.com) installed, run the client with a Docker image (recommended):

```sh
docker run --rm yepcode/tunnels-client:latest -V
```

The Docker image has 2 advantages:

- It keeps retrying to reconnect if SSH tunnel connection is lost.
- It implements a reverse HTTP proxy, rewriting the HTTP 'Host' header for local hostname matching when creating a tunnel to an HTTP service.

### YepCode Tunnels Server Access

Server parameterss:

```
Server: tunnels.yepcode.io
Port: 2222
Recommended ssh params:
  - ExitOnForwardFailure=yes
  - ServerAliveInterval=10
  - ServerAliveCountMax=3
```

The tunnels server connection is private, and you need us to provide you with a private key. To obtain that private key, please [contact us](https://yepcode.io/contact/).

### HTTP Tunnel Creation Sample

Suposse you want to expose an HTTP service running on `http://192.168.108.10:3000`. You can use the following Docker run commands:

```sh title="SSH client"
ssh -o "ExitOnForwardFailure=yes"-o "ServerAliveInterval=10" -o "ServerAliveCountMax=3" \
  -i /path/to/id_rsa_you_have_asked_for \
  -p 2222 tunnels.yepcode.io \
  -R my-company-http-service:80:192.168.108.10:3000
```

```sh title="Docker image, not using reverse proxy"
docker run --rm -e ID_RSA=$(base64 -w 0 /path/to/id_rsa_you_have_asked_for) yepcode/tunnels-client:latest \
  -R my-company-http-service:80:192.168.108.10:3000
```

```sh title="Docker image, using reverse proxy"
docker run --rm -e ID_RSA=$(base64 -w 0 /path/to/id_rsa_you_have_asked_for) yepcode/tunnels-client:latest \
  --http my-company-http-service,http://192.168.108.10:3000
```

With this execution you'll see something like this:

```sh
Starting SSH Forwarding service for http:80. Forwarded connections can be accessed via the following methods:
HTTP: http://my-company-http-service.tunnels.yepcode.io
```

If you open a network connection to `http://my-company-http-service.tunnels.yepcode.io`, it will end up at your private service.

Note that this client process must be running whenever you want to use the integration.

### TCP Tunnel Creation Sample

Suposse you want to expose a MySQL service available at `192.168.108.10:3306`. You can use the following Docker run command:

```sh
docker run --rm -e ID_RSA=$(base64 -w 0 /path/to/id_rsa_you_have_asked_for) yepcode/tunnels-client:latest \
  -R 12345:192.168.108.10:3306
```

With this execution you'll see something like this:

```sh
Starting SSH Forwarding service for tcp:12345. Forwarded connections can be accessed via the following methods:
TCP: tunnels.yepcode.io:12345
```

Configure the YepCode integration with the host and port credentials as `tunnels.yepcode.io:12345`

You can combine multiple tunnels in one execution:

```sh
docker run --rm -e ID_RSA=$(base64 -w 0 /path/to/id_rsa_you_have_asked_for) yepcode/tunnels-client:latest \
  --http my-company-http-service,http://api.my-company.com/ \
  --http my-company-https-service,https://api.my-company.com:4443/ \
  -R 12345:192.168.108.10:3306 \
  -R 12346:192.168.108.11:5432
```

### Docker Compose

Here is an example of `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  yepcode_tunnels:
    container_name: yepcode-tunnels
    image: yepcode/tunnels-client:latest
    restart: always
    command: -R 12345:internal_server:3306 --http my-company-http-service,http://api.my-company.com/
    environment:
      - ID_RSA=... # write here id_rsa private key in base64 format
```
