# Why this docs directory is nested?

A subdirectory docs must exist. See [Starlight docs](https://starlight.astro.build/manual-setup/#use-starlight-at-a-subpath).

To add all Starlight pages at a subpath, place all your docs content inside a subdirectory of src/content/docs/.

In the future, we plan to support this use case better to avoid the need for the extra nested directory in src/content/docs/.
